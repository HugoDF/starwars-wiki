##Â Implementation

- The homepage includes a list of characters (the first page of characters in the `/people/` response from the API).
- Each character has their own profile page where you can see their bio and links to their home planet and starship pages.
- Linked planets and starships also have a 'bio' page.
- Loading states are taken into account.
- Errors are handled with correct messages when the API call fails.
- Thoroughly tested using chai, enzyme and sinon.
